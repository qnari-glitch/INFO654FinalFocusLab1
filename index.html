      <h3>What is FocusLab?</h3>
      <p>
        FocusLab is an educational website designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners understand how attention works in everyday life. Many people think focus is simply a matter of “trying harder,” but research in psychology shows that attention is shaped by design choices, habits, and the environments we work in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than offering generic productivity tips, FocusLab connects ideas from cognitive science to real-world study practices, digital behaviors, and personal routines. Our goal is to help visitors build realistic, sustainable focus habits instead of short bursts of motivation.

  <h3>What You Can Find Here</h3>
  <p>
    FocusLab is organized into a small set of pages that you can explore from the menu in the upper-right corner. Each page focuses on a different part of the overall goal: helping people understand their attention and build more sustainable study habits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>About</strong> page introduces the project, explains why we created FocusLab. The <strong>Tools</strong> page collects simple exercises, such as focus timers, distraction checklists, and reflection prompts that visitors can try in their own study routines. The <strong>Resources</strong> page gathers articles, guides, and other media for people who want to read more about attention, multitasking, and learning strategies. The <strong>Home</strong> page, where you are now, gives an overview of the site and suggests how to get started.
