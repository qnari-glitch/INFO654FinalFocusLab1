      <h3>Why These Resources Matter</h3>
      <p>
        FocusLab approaches attention as more than a personal skill — it is shaped by environments, tools,
        habits, and cultural expectations. The articles featured below introduce additional perspectives
        from journalism, research, and reflective practice. Each source invites readers to think more
        broadly about how focus is cultivated, challenged, and supported in everyday life.

      <h3>How We Attribute Sources</h3>
      <p>
        All external articles linked on this page open in a new tab and are attributed with their platform,
        author (where available), and publication year. We do not reproduce copyrighted material — instead,
        we direct visitors to the original publishers in accordance with academic integrity and fair use
        principles.
