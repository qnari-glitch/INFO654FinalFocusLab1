      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        FocusLab is an educational website and study tool that explores how attention, time management, and digital well-being shape learning in today’s world. In a digital environment filled with constant notifications, open tabs, and social media, it is easy for students to feel scattered and mentally drained. FocusLab responds to this challenge by combining clear explanations with practical tools that help visitors notice their habits and experiment with more sustainable study routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than treating focus as a simple matter of willpower, the project approaches attention as something that is affected by design choices, technologies, and everyday environments. Our goal is to create a space where students can reflect on how they work, recognize common patterns of distraction, and try small adjustments that support their concentration over time.

      <h3>Why We Created FocusLab</h3>
      <p>
        Both of us have experienced how hard it can be to stay focused while studying with laptops and phones nearby. During our coursework, we noticed how often classmates mentioned feeling overwhelmed by constant digital input. We wanted to design a project that not only describes this problem but also offers concrete strategies that feel realistic for students who are already busy and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        FocusLab grows out of this shared experience. Instead of promising quick fixes, the site emphasizes small, repeatable practices: creating boundaries around notifications, planning focused blocks of time, and building in short, intentional breaks. The project is meant to be practical and encouraging rather than judgmental.

      <h3>How the Site Is Structured</h3>
      <p>
        The FocusLab website is organized into a set of pages that visitors can reach from the navigation bar. The Home page introduces the overall purpose of the project and briefly explains the main sections of the site. The About page, where you are now, documents the background of the project, its goals, and our roles as collaborators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other pages go into more depth. Content pages explain ideas about attention, multitasking, and balance in digital life, while the tools section highlights interactive features that support focused study. Together, these pages are meant to work as a small ecosystem: visitors can read, reflect, and then immediately try out simple exercises that relate to what they have just learned.

      <h3>Technologies and Interactive Tools</h3>
      <p>
        FocusLab is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following a minimalist design approach for clarity and accessibility. We aim for a consistent layout, a cohesive color palette, and typography that supports extended reading on different devices. The site also incorporates external APIs to make the experience more dynamic and responsive to a visitor’s context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project includes two primary interactive components. The Pomodoro Focus Timer provides a 25-minute study session with a gentle prompt to take a short break at the end. The Mindful Weather &amp; Advice widget combines real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API with short pieces of advice from the AdviceSlip API. Together, these features are designed to make studying feel a bit more grounded, supportive, and even playful.

      <h3>Team and Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        FocusLab is a collaborative project by Alex Wang and Qinraocuomu Nari for the Information Technologies course with Professor Rik Vanmechelen at Pratt Institute. We worked together on the overall concept, site structure, and written content, while dividing some of the technical and design tasks to match our strengths and interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alex focused more on JavaScript functionality, including the Pomodoro timer and API integration for the Mindful Weather &amp; Advice widget. Nari concentrated more on information architecture, content drafting, and visual design decisions such as typography, layout, and page hierarchy. Throughout the project, we reviewed each other’s work, tested the site on different devices, and refined the design based on feedback. This About page serves as a record of our shared process and individual contributions for academic and portfolio purposes.
